lab-2-snowpipe-monitoring builds on your Snowpipe knowledge by implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for continuous data ingestion. You'll set up queries to monitor COPY_HISTORY for load success rates, implement error handling for failed ingestions, and create alerts for data pipeline issues. This ensures the reliability of your real-time data ingestion processes in production environments.
