lab-1-warehouse-scaling explores Snowflake's unique approach to compute resources through virtual warehouses. You'll experiment with different warehouse sizes to understand performance characteristics, implement multi-cluster warehouses for handling concurrent workloads, and learn auto-scaling and auto-suspension patterns that optimize cost. This lab emphasizes the importance of right-sizing compute resources for different types of analytical queries.
