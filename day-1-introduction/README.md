Day 1 README.md provides the comprehensive overview and learning objectives for your initial immersion into the Snowflake and Azure Databricks ecosystem. This document outlines the fundamental architecture concepts you'll master, including Snowflake's unique separation of storage and compute layers, the role of cloud services in query coordination, and how Azure Databricks integrates as a powerful transformation engine. It sets the stage for understanding how these technologies work together in modern data platform architectures and prepares you for the hands-on labs that build from basic setup to complex integrations.
