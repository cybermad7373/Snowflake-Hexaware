lab-4-adls-mount demonstrates how to integrate Azure Data Lake Storage as a scalable data source for your analytics platform. You'll mount ADLS containers directly into Databricks using secure service principal authentication, explore different mounting strategies for optimal performance, and learn how to efficiently read and write data between the data lake and your processing engine. This establishes the pattern for working with cloud object storage that underpins modern data lakehouse architectures.
