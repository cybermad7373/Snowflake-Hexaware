lab-1-sso-setup introduces you to enterprise-grade authentication by implementing Single Sign-On between Azure Active Directory and Snowflake. You'll work through configuring Azure AD as an identity provider in Snowflake, setting up security integrations that allow users to authenticate using their corporate credentials, and testing the end-to-end login flow. This lab establishes the security foundation that will be used throughout all subsequent exercises, ensuring that access control follows enterprise standards from the very beginning.
