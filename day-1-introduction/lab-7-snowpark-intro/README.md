lab-7-snowpark-intro provides your first exposure to Snowpark API, which represents a paradigm shift in how developers interact with Snowflake. You'll learn the fundamental concepts of DataFrames and lazy evaluation, write your first Snowpark Python code to query and transform data, and understand how Snowpark enables complex data engineering workflows to be pushed down into Snowflake's processing engine rather than bringing data to the code.
