Case-study brings together all the Day 1 concepts into a realistic migration scenario where you'll architect the movement of an on-premises SQL Server database to the cloud. You'll extract schema definitions and data from SQL Server, transform the data within Databricks using PySpark to align with cloud-native formats, and load the refined data into Snowflake using optimized patterns. This end-to-end exercise reinforces the practical application of all the individual skills you've developed throughout the day's labs.
