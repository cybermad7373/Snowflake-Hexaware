lab-3-databricks-connector bridges the gap between Azure Databricks and Snowflake by implementing the robust connectivity that enables seamless data movement between these platforms. You'll configure the Snowflake Spark connector within your Databricks environment, establish secure connection parameters using key-based authentication, and test bidirectional data transfer capabilities. This connection forms the critical pipeline that will be used for all subsequent data engineering workflows between the two systems.
