lab-7-stored-procedures leverages Snowpark to create sophisticated stored procedures that encapsulate complex security logic. You'll write stored procedures for dynamic data masking, implement procedures for automated security auditing, and create reusable security modules that can be deployed across different environments. This extends Snowflake's native security capabilities with custom business logic.
