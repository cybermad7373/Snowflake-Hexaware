lab-2-column-security implements data protection through Snowflake's dynamic data masking capabilities. You'll create masking policies that protect sensitive columns like personally identifiable information, implement different masking strategies based on user roles, and test the masking behavior across different query scenarios. This ensures that sensitive data is automatically protected without requiring application changes.
