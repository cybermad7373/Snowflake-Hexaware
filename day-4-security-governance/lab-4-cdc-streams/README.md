lab-4-cdc-streams introduces Change Data Capture patterns using Snowflake Streams and Tasks. You'll create streams that track data changes in source tables, set up tasks that process the change data on scheduled intervals, and implement CDC pipelines that propagate changes through your data warehouse. This enables near-real-time data synchronization across different parts of your data platform.
