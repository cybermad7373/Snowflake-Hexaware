lab-2-dynamic-tables explores Snowflake's approach to incremental data processing through dynamic tables. You'll create dynamic tables that automatically refresh based on source data changes, implement incremental merge patterns that efficiently update large datasets, and optimize dynamic table performance for different refresh scenarios. This represents the evolution beyond traditional materialized views.
