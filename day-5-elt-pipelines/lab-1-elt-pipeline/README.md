lab-1-elt-pipeline designs and implements a complete ELT pipeline that extracts data from Azure SQL Database, loads it into Snowflake, and performs transformations using Snowpark. You'll architect the end-to-end data flow, implement error handling and retry logic, and set up monitoring for pipeline health. This establishes the pattern for modern data integration that leverages cloud-native transformation capabilities.
