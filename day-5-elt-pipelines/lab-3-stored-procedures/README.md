lab-3-stored-procedures extends your Snowpark programming skills by creating sophisticated stored procedures that automate complex data transformation workflows. You'll implement data validation procedures, create data quality checks, and build procedural logic that orchestrates multi-step transformation processes. This enables you to move complex business logic into the data layer where it can execute more efficiently.
