lab-5-time-travel utilizes Snowflake's built-in time travel feature for data recovery and historical analysis. You'll query historical versions of tables to recover from accidental data modifications, analyze data changes over time for audit purposes, and implement data retention policies that balance recovery capabilities with storage costs. This provides powerful data protection without requiring additional backup infrastructure.
