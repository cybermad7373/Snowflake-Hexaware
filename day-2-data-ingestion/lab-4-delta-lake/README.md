lab-4-delta-lake integrates Delta Lake as the storage layer for your data engineering workflows, providing ACID transactions and schema evolution capabilities on cloud storage. You'll create Delta tables in Databricks, perform upserts and merges that maintain data integrity, implement time travel queries to access historical data versions, and optimize Delta tables for query performance. This establishes the foundation for building reliable data lakehouses.
