lab-5-adf-orchestration uses Azure Data Factory as the orchestration layer that coordinates complex data pipelines across multiple services. You'll design ADF pipelines that trigger Databricks notebooks for data transformation, execute Snowflake stored procedures for data loading, and implement dependency management between pipeline activities. This demonstrates how to build production-grade data workflows with proper monitoring and error handling.
