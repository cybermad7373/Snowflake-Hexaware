lab-2-snowpipe introduces Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service that enables near-real-time data loading. You'll set up Snowpipe to automatically load files as they arrive in Azure Blob Storage, configure Azure Event Grid to notify Snowflake of new file arrivals, and monitor the auto-ingestion process to ensure reliable data flow. This demonstrates the serverless, event-driven approach to data ingestion that eliminates the need for scheduling batch jobs
