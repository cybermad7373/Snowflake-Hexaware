lab-7-snowpark-udf extends Snowpark's functionality by creating user-defined functions that encapsulate custom business logic. You'll write Python UDFs for data validation and cleansing, register these functions in Snowflake, and learn the performance implications of different UDF types. This enables you to push complex transformations down to the data layer rather than processing in application code.
