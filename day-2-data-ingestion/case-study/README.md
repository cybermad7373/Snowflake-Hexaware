case-study implements a real-time log analytics pipeline that processes streaming JSON log data from application servers. You'll configure the ingestion of log files from Azure Data Lake, transform the semi-structured log data using Snowpark in Databricks, enrich the data with reference information, and load it into Snowflake for analytical querying. This realistic scenario demonstrates how to handle high-volume, rapidly arriving data in a cloud-native architecture.
