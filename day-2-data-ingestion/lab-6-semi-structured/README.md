lab-6-semi-structured explores Snowflake's powerful capabilities for working with semi-structured data formats like JSON and Parquet. You'll learn to query nested JSON data using path expressions, flatten complex hierarchical structures into relational formats, and optimize semi-structured data storage for query performance. This is increasingly important as modern applications generate more complex, nested data structures.
