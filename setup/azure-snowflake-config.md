azure-snowflake-config.md focuses specifically on establishing secure and reliable connectivity between your Azure cloud environment and Snowflake data platform. This guide takes you through the process of creating an Azure Service Principal with appropriate permissions for automated authentication, configuring network security groups and firewall rules to enable seamless communication between services, setting up Azure Active Directory integration for single sign-on capabilities, and establishing encrypted connection strings that will be used throughout all subsequent labs. It also covers the configuration of shared access signatures for Azure Storage and the setup of managed identities that will allow Azure services to securely access Snowflake without storing credentials in code.
